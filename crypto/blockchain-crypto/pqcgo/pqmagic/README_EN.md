# PQMagic

[PQMagic](https://pqcrypto.dev/) (Post-Quantum Magic) is the first **high-performance post-quantum cryptographic algorithm library** that supports both the [FIPS 203 204 205](https://csrc.nist.gov/news/2024/postquantum-cryptography-fips-approved) standards in China, and it supports the higher performance PQC algorithms designed by us: **Aigis-Enc、Aigis-Sig** ([PKC 2020]((https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/510))) and **SPHINCS-Alpha** ([CRYPTO 2023](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/059)).

This project is developed and maintained by Professor Yu Yu's team from the [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://crypto.sjtu.edu.cn/lab/) and the [Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute]((https://sqz.ac.cn/password-48)). It aims to provide secure and **high-performance** PQC algorithms, offers solutions for post-quantum cryptography migration in various scenarios.

## Usage

### Use CMake

- Use following command:
  
  ```bash
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  make install
  ```

  - The correctness test binaries (`test_xxxx`) and benchmark binaries (`bench_xxxx`) are containd in `build/bin` dirctory.
  - The shared/static library files are contained in `/usr/local/lib`
  - The header files are contained in `/usr/local/include`

- Specify the install dir:
  
  ```bash
  cmake .. --install-prefix=/path/to/your/installdir
  ```

  - The correctness test binaries (`test_xxxx`) and benchmark binaries (`bench_xxxx`) are still containd in `build/bin` dirctory.
  - The shared/static library files and header files are placed in `/path/to/your/installdir/lib` and `/path/to/your/installdir/include` respectively.

- Specify the parameters of algorithms:

  ```bash
  cmake .. -DSOME_PARAM=2 -DOTHER_PARAM=OFF
  ```
  
  - One can specify the parameters using `cmake`
  - ML-KEM: One can set `ML_KEM_MODE` as `512,768,1024` (default set all) to change different ML-KEM parameters.
  - Kyber: One can set `KYBER_MODE` as `2,3,4` (default set all) to change different Kyber parameters.
  - Aigis-enc: One can set `AIGIS_ENC_MODE` as `1,2,3,4` (default set all) to change different Aigis-enc parameters.
  - ML-DSA: One can set `ML_DSA_MODE` as `44,65,87` (default set all) to change different ML-DSA parameters.
  - SLH-DSA: One can set `SLH_DSA_MODE` as `[128|192|256][f|s]` mode with SHA2/SHAKE and `128f/s` with SM3
  - Dilithium: One can set `DILITHIUM_MODE` as `2,3,5` (default set all) to change different Dilithium parameters.
  - Aigis-sig: One can set `AIGIS_SIG_MODE` as `1,2,3` (default set all) to change different Aigis-sig parameters.
  - SPHINCS-Alpha: One can set `SPHINCS_A_MODE` as `[128|192|256][f|s]` mode with SHA2/SHAKE and `128f/s` with SM3
  - Set `ENABLE_ML_KEM`、`ENABLE_KYBER`、`ENABLE_AIGIS_ENC`、`ENABLE_ML_DSA`、`ENABLE_SLH_DSA`、`ENABLE_DILITHIUM`、`ENABLE_AIGIS_SIG` or `ENABLE_SPHINCS_A` as `OFF` to remove related algorithm out of the compiled binaries and libraries (default `ON`).
